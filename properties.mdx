Feedback is the unit in our app. Each feedback has an unique ID that we tracked internally and used for join data later.
For each feedback, we provide the following fields:

### Description

Description holds the context of each feedback. This is where we will dive into with our models to identify the intent and context easily.
You can easily fill in, and edit the description with the ui.

### Title (Optional)

Title is only shown if the feedback comes from public voting portal.

### Customer

Each feedback is tied to one customer, which could be your user, customer, or simply any person entity that raises feedback.
Customer is also an important entity here - we will enhance each customer unit with the metadata that pulled from analytics / data tools to polish the profile of customer, so you know who the customer is, and what feedback they have raised.
